# ðŸ“š P3X Onenote Linux v1.2.344-426  

This is an open-source project. Star this repository if you like it, or even donate!  Thank you so much! :)

I run my own server with dynamic IP address so it may happen that the server can not be reachable for about max 5 minutes due to the dynamic DNS. The server may also be unreachable when I backup the SSD with Clonzilla (very rarely) or an electrical issue (but this should not happen again). When the server is down, please hang on for 5-30 minutes and the server will be back up.

All my domains (patrikx3.com and corifeus.com) could have errors since I am developing in my free time. However, it is usually stable.

# Downloadable installer

https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/releases

After downloading the ```AppImage```, make it an executable.
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt
sudo mv ~/Downloads/p3x-onenote-a.b.c-d-x86_64.AppImage /opt/p3x-onenote.Appimage
sudo chmod +x /opt/p3x-onenote.AppImage
# Then you can run it
/opt/p3x-onenote.AppImage &
```

The app can also be found on [Atom Apps](https://electron.atom.io/apps/?q=onenote)

If you want to install it on NodeJs instead of the AppImage, it is deprecated, but available [here](https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/blob/c78e77c540e21b89e0e063cd50a10707faae722e/README.md#cli-install)

<!--
## Important Note

Check the ```Keep me signed in``` checkbox when entering your password then choose any page (but not a notebook) after logging in. This will keep you logged in.


**Do not install this app using the Command Line Interface (CLI) as it is deprecated**

The ```CLI``` installation does not always work due the updating of Linux distros.  Is is possible the ```configstore``` only works with ```sudo```, so use the ```released``` ```AppImage``` instead!

Installation of ```NodeJs``` is not necessary since the ```AppImage``` includes all dependencies.

```bash
# If this weird NPM error is encountered, do the following:
node -v
# make sure the node version is above 8.9.0
sudo npm install -g p3x-onenote --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
p3x-onenote
```

Logout and relogin, and a menu will now appear.
-->

# Info about P3X Onenote vs VirtualBox

If you have enough RAM or buffy workstation and you can install VirtualBox inside Windows and use the Marketplace based OneNote or install Office. I think, you do not need  ```p3x-onenote``` at all.  

For my workstation, with a 4.8Ghz CPU, 4 cores, 32 GB-ram, I use VirtualBox on Windows with Office Onenote (I use 6 GB RAM, 4 cores), but unfortunately my Laptop is old and has only 16GB RAM. Given, I develop a lot (NodeJs), I need the RAM, so for my Laptop, I use ```p3x-onenote``` and it's enough. Once the pages are loaded. It is fast, since it's own process without a browser and is in the tray, you don't have to re-load everything again. So it is very usable and after all pages are loaded, quick.

**You can try, you lose nothing.**

# Issues

## Unable to log in

This only happens if you kill ```P3X OneNote Linux``` and then relogin many times. So, If the program needs to be killed often, ```sign out``` (on the top right of the Electron browser frame) just to be safe.

### BUT!

**Exiting using ```quit``` from the ```p3x-onenote``` menu or the tray, will prevent the problem.**

## Latest Gnome with dash-to-panel

The latest ```Gnome``` version with ```dash-to-panel``` removed the ```legacy tray``` icons so that ```Electron``` (and other programs, including ```Skype``` ) do not work with the ```real original tray```. This is not an ```Electron``` or ```p3x-onenote``` issue, but a ```Gnome``` ```dash-to-panel``` problem.   


## Fedora

https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/issues/3#issuecomment-312711801

## Change language

Although the main page's language can be changed, it reverts back when an actual page is accessed.
This is being investigated.
