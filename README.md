# P3X Onenote Linux

## Issues / Support
This is an open source project. Time is a precious thing, so I have rarely time to give support and fix issues for someone else. I fix a bug, when I have an error that I need. If you got an issue, error or bug, I hope someone will have time to do it for you, otherwise, you are on your own.

Though, if I know the solution, I will tell you. Besides, core errors will be fixed by me.

***If you want to extend, fix bugs or add in new features, I promptly merge pull requests or you can become a ```patrikx3``` member.***

Besides, when I can support, please note, I cannot support old versions, only the current/latest version.

### Node Version Requirement 
```

```  
   
### Built on Node
